# About the Author

I'm an IT professional, Systems Engineer and budding entrepreneur. I work for [E*Trade](http://us.etrade.com), I love automating things and dream of the day when when deploying websites is so simple that we never have to login to a linux box. 

I'm also a book worm, traveler, scuba diver, sailor, aquarist, horticulturist, foodie, husband, and father. If only there was more time in the world...
