<p>I'm an IT Professional, Systems Engineer and budding entrepreneur. I currently work for <a href="http://www.threatmetrix.com">ThreatMetrix</a> and privously served stints at <a href="http://us.etrade.com">E*Trade Financial</a> and <a href="http://www.cardiodx.com">CardioDx</a>. I love automating things and dream of the day when systems are smart enough to never need to login to a Linux box.</p>

<p>I'm also a bookworm, traveler, scuba diver, sailor, aquarist, horticulturist, runner, anime watcher, foodie, husband, and father. If only there was more time in the world... If you really want to know more about me then check out my <a href="http://about.me/robert.birnie">about.me</a> for a list of other places I commonly lurk.</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts while reading this site I'd love to hear them. You can contact me on <a href="http://twitter.com/Robert_Birnie">Twitter</a>, or via <a href="mailto:rbirnie@gmail.com">email</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>
